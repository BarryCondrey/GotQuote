GotQuote - Game of Thrones Quotes 
Release 1.0
Author: Barry@Condrey.org 

Notes: 
I was always captured by the dialog in GOT. I ead the books 
first, and then watched the HBO movies many times. I wanted to create 
sort of a "fortune" program, but that would return the GOT quotes. 
I skulked some of the internet lists of quotes, and found 192 
unique quotes. Note that some of the internet lists have lots of duplicates. 
For example, a dozen people said "Winter is coming", we don't need a dozen quotes. 

Arguments: 
-d = A bit of debug output. 
-a = Print all the quotes 

Called without arguments, it will print a random quote. 

This was originally written on a Raspberry Pi, under Raspbian.
I then ported it in about 30 seconds to OSX. 

Have fun. Note that one or two of the quotes use crude 
language. You have been warned! 

Just download the source and make.
